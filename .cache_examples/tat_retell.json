["I will try to retell it in my own words.", "Use your own words to retell the content of the lesson.", "During the spring of 1931, Ben Black Elk translated his father's words for writer John Neihardt. In the years that followed, and particularly after his father's death in 1950, Ben Black Elk became one of the last links to the \"old ways\" of his people. He often visited local schools to retell traditional stories of Lakota history and culture to students. Some of those sessions were recorded by Lakota educator Warfield Moose, Sr., who entrusted the tapes to his son in 1996."]
