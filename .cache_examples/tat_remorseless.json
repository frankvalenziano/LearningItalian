["Bruno reacted in a very remorseless way.", "But in the few short weeks since, she had caught more than one glimpse of Primeval Nature,â€”she of the bloody fang, blind, remorseless, insensate, destroying, ever destroying.", "O Muse, assist me and inspire my song, / the various causes and the crimes relate, / for what affronted majesty, what wrong / to injured Godhead, what offence so great / Heaven's Queen resenting, with remorseless hate, / could one renowned for piety compel / to brave such troubles, and endure the weight / of toils so many and so huge. O tell / how can in heavenly minds such fierce resentment dwell?"]
