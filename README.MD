# CEFR Italian Language Progression Project

## Project Purpose
This project aims to provide a structured plan and requirements for progressing through the CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages) scales, from A1 (Beginner) to C2 (Mastery). It is designed to help learners understand what is expected at each level and offers actionable steps to achieve proficiency in Italian (or any other language using CEFR). The content in this deck was generated with a combination of wiktionary word lists and ChatGPT 5.

## What Are the CEFR Scales?
The CEFR is an internationally recognized framework for describing language ability. It divides proficiency into six levels:

- **A1 (Beginner):** Can understand and use familiar everyday expressions and very basic phrases.
- **A2 (Elementary):** Can communicate in simple and routine tasks requiring a direct exchange of information.
- **B1 (Intermediate):** Can deal with most situations likely to arise while traveling, and can produce simple connected text.
- **B2 (Upper Intermediate):** Can interact with a degree of fluency and spontaneity, and produce clear, detailed text.
- **C1 (Advanced):** Can use language flexibly and effectively for social, academic, and professional purposes.
- **C2 (Mastery):** Can understand virtually everything heard or read, and express themselves spontaneously, very fluently, and precisely.
