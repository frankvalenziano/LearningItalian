# Italian Flashcard Project – Telling Time

## Overview
In Italy, the **24-hour time format** is commonly used in writing (e.g., timetables, schedules, digital clocks).  
However, in everyday conversation, Italians typically **speak the time as if it were the 12-hour format**—often adding clarifying words like *di mattina* (in the morning), *di pomeriggio* (in the afternoon), *di sera* (in the evening), or *di notte* (at night).

To reflect this cultural and linguistic difference, the **CSV files in this project** are designed as follows:
- **Italian side:** Displays the time in **24-hour format** (e.g., `14:00`).
- **English translation side:** Shows the **12-hour format equivalent** (e.g., `2:00 PM`), which mirrors how Italians would express the time in speech.

This structure helps learners:
1. Recognize **written Italian time** as it appears in schedules, transportation timetables, and official documents.
2. Understand and **translate to the spoken English equivalent**, reinforcing how Italians actually communicate time in conversation.

## Examples

| Italian (24h) | English (12h) |
|---------------|---------------|
| 14:00         | 2:00 PM       |
| 09:30         | 9:30 AM       |
| 21:15         | 9:15 PM       |

## Context Words for Time
Since Italians often omit “AM” and “PM” in speech, they rely on **context words** to indicate the part of the day:

| Italian phrase         | Literal meaning       | Approximate English equivalent | Pronunciation |
|------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------|---------------|
| **di mattina**         | of the morning        | AM (morning)                   | dee maht-TEE-nah |
| **di pomeriggio**      | of the afternoon      | PM (afternoon)                  | dee poh-meh-REEJ-joh |
| **di sera**            | of the evening        | PM (evening)                    | dee SEH-rah |
| **di notte**           | of the night          | PM/AM (nighttime)               | dee NOHT-teh |

## Pronunciation Tips for Telling Time
1. **“Le” before the hour**  
   - Use *le* (plural article) before most hours: *le tre* (3:00), *le otto* (8:00).  
   - Exception: *È l’una* (1:00) — singular, so it uses *l’*.
   
2. **Minutes past the hour**  
   - Use *e* (and) for minutes past: *le due e cinque* (2:05), *le nove e venti* (9:20).
   - *e mezza* = “and a half” (half past) → *le sette e mezza* (7:30).
   - *e un quarto* = “and a quarter” (quarter past) → *le nove e un quarto* (9:15).

3. **Minutes to the next hour**  
   - Use *meno* (minus) for times before the hour: *le cinque meno dieci* (4:50) = “ten to five”.

4. **Pronouncing numbers**  
   - 1 → *uno* (OO-noh)  
   - 2 → *due* (DOO-eh)  
   - 3 → *tre* (treh)  
   - 4 → *quattro* (KWAH-troh)  
   - 5 → *cinque* (CHEEN-kweh)  
   - 6 → *sei* (SEH-ee)  
   - 7 → *sette* (SEHT-teh)  
   - 8 → *otto* (OHT-toh)  
   - 9 → *nove* (NOH-veh)  
   - 10 → *dieci* (DYEH-chee)
