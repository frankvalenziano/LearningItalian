["How many Shakespearean tragedies did you read?", "It's before dawn, this 3rd of August of 2025, here on Lulu Island. I just ate a fig and am drinking hot lime water in the lamp-illumined living room. Yesterday, I saw a stocky Filipino full of Cambodian tattoos, as he told me that he stayed 4 years in Cambodia. He asked for just a small tattoo from the tattoo lady artist, but she then tattooed his whole body. At first, I thought of Tibetan tattoos, but they were Cambodian. The day before yesterday was exceptionally a day of brown Adonises at Tim Hortons café: one brown full of tattoos in the morning and in the afternoon another who spoke in a language which I thought was Maltese—at least some language that was Arabic mixed with something. In recent days, I have been asking Artificial Intelligence to write Shakespearean plays in Elizabethan English—remarkable and fascinating artwork for a machine!"]
