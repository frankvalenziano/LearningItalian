["\"To thy guardian care / she doth her Gods and ministries consign. / Take them, thy future destinies to share, / and seek for them another home elsewhere, / that mighty city, which for thee and thine / o'er traversed ocean shall the Fates prepare.\"", "\"There, when at Cumae landing from the main, / Avernus' lakes and sounding woods ye gain, / thyself shalt see, within her rock-hewn shrine, / the frenzied prophetess, whose mystic strain / expounds the Fates, to leaves of trees consign / the notes and names that mark the oracles divine.\"", "East Asian graphemes, particularly sinograms, often mesmerize Westerners.

Indeed, Westerners and Easterners alike may find mystique in such scripts. Korean, unlike Japanese and Chinese, can make do with just phonograms, as Koreans consign their sinograms to \"higher\" literature. In retrospect, I should have taken Korean in tandem with Japanese during university."]
